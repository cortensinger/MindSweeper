# MindSweeper: Towards haptic cognitive prostheses

Project completed in Fall 2016 as part of undergraduate research with Tom√°s Vega, under Prof. Bjoern Hartmann

Technical components:
 - Arduino: Embedded firmware development
 - OpenCV: Open-source computer vision library to understand the MineSweeper game as the user plays in real-time
 - Eagle: Electronics hardware design
 - Fusion 360: 3D printable wearable design

This was an interesting human-computer interaction research project from UC Berkeley, Department of EECS. We investigate an intelligent wearable feedback system capable of offloading cognitive demand during task exucation. We use the classic computer game Minesweeper as our task due to its challenging arithmetic nature. Simultaneously, we study the effects of designing novel haptic techniques that stimulate particular mechanoreceptors in our dermis/subdermis. The overall goal is to explore new human-computer interfaces that better utilize our natural sensing capabilities in order to convey information more effectively.
